I joined the Horticulture Section faculty in 2022 as an associate professor of fruit crop physiology and climate adaptation. Previously, I was a Research Geneticist with the USDA-ARS Grape Genetics Unit, located at Cornell AgriTech in Geneva, New York.

My extension program goals are to provide research driven-tools and information to the New York fruit crop industry focusing on adapting crops to climate-change-induced environmental stress.  I work collaboratively with other faculty members, Cornell Cooperative Extension, and stakeholders to identify climate induced disorders, develop mitigation methods, and improve the resilience and sustainability of fruit crop production through applied research.

I manage the Cornell grapevine cold hardiness monitoring program and associated website. My current research is focusing on understanding aspects of winter hardiness and spring deacclimation in apples and grapes to identify the rootstocks and scion combinations that provide the greatest resistance to early winter warming conditions.
