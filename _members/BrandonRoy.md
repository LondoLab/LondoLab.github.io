Brandon completed his B.S. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Lebanon Valley College in Annville, Pennsylvania. He first came to Geneva, NY as a Cornell AgriTech Summer Scholar in 2019, and joined the lab of Dr. Marc Fuchs within the Plant Pathology and Plant-Microbe Biology Section. Brandon has developed a passion for molecular benchwork and computational biology to understand host and pathogen interactions through RNA-Seq, genomics, and proteomics. He joined the Londo Lab in May 2025 as a post-doc where he is investigating the molecular components of grapevine climate adaptation.
